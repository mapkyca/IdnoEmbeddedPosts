Idno Embedded Posts
===================

This plugin gives you a way to embed your posts into other sites (for example a wordpress blog) and to be able to build a conversation around it.

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, so get involved**

Installation
------------

 * Install into your IdnoPlugins directory and activate it in the plugins setting panel.
 * You wanted more?

Todo
----
* [X] Link to generate embed code
* [X] Nice / complete embed code with CSS (we have a proof of concept right now)
* [ ] Change embed method away from Iframe to something similar to how twitter does it, perhaps making use of Idno's jsonp api
